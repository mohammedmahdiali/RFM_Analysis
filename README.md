# RFM

**RFM** is a strategy for analyzing and estimating the value of a customer, based on three data points: Recency (How recently did the customer make a purchase?), Frequency (How often do they purchase), and Monetary Value (How much do they spend?).

### This method gives customers scores based on 3 factors:

**Recency**: Recency refers to how recent a customer's **last purchase was**. Customers who have made a recent purchase, typically within the last few weeks, still have the product and brand on their minds and are most likely to make a repeat purchase. You can measure recency however you deem necessary for your business. However, it's important to note that some companies might not have customers ordering every few days, weeks, or even months. For example, a car company might sell a single car to an individual within ten years.

**Frequency**: Frequency is how often the customer makes purchases, which can help you identify repeat customers. For example, many clients make frequent repeat purchases within a set timeframe. Frequency is essential in determining the individuals most likely to continue shopping with your brand after their first initial purchase.

**Monetary value**: Monetary value refers to how much a customer spends within a given period. It's always important to consider because it can tell you a few things about consumer **behavior**. For example, you might find that customers with the highest monetary value don't purchase items as frequently as others but typically buy the most expensive products when they do.
